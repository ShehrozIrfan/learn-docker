# learn-docker
This is the repository that contains information about various docker commands that I've learned from the educative course.
The commands list:
- [Use docker images](https://github.com/ShehrozIrfan/learn-docker/blob/master/use-docker-images.md)
- [Create docker images](https://github.com/ShehrozIrfan/learn-docker/blob/master/create-docker-images.md)
